# working on taskCard and datePicker

- [X] SCHEDULING ERROR: at least at 16:56, marking days as scheduled marks THE WRONG DAY
+ [X] clicking on "add progress" or "complete" is broken
+ [X] issues moving to backlog
+ [X] Completions in the future shouldn't mark the task complete
+ [X] fuel gauge for scheduled tasks
+ [ ] Drinks scheduled for 28 days cannot select or modify anything
  + [ ] I think the solution to this is to fix the underlying data
  + [ ] It's hard to fix with the UI though. How should we do it?
- for things in the future, we need a scheduling function instead.
