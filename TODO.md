# working on taskCard and datePicker

- [X] SCHEDULING ERROR: at least at 16:56, marking days as scheduled marks THE WRONG DAY
+ [X] clicking on "add progress" or "complete" is broken
+ issues moving to backlog
+ [X] Completions in the future shouldn't mark the task complete
+ fuel gauge for scheduled tasks
- for things in the future, we need a scheduling function instead.
